/**
 * Reads [awaitFirstDown], and [AwaitPointerEventScope.awaitPointerEvent] to

 * [onDown], [onMove], and [onUp].
 *
 * To prevent other pointer functions that call [awaitFirstDown]
 * or [AwaitPointerEventScope.awaitPointerEvent]
 * (scroll, swipe, detect functions)
 * receiving changes call [PointerInputChange.consume]  in [onMove]  or call
 * [PointerInputChange.consume] in [onDown] to prevent events
 * that check first pointer interaction.
 *
 * @param onDown is invoked when first pointer is down initially.
 * @param onMove one or multiple pointers are being moved on screen.
 * @param onUp last pointer is up
 * @param delayAfterDownInMillis is optional delay after [onDown] This delay might be
 * required Composables like **Canvas** to process [onDown] before [onMove]
 * @param requireUnconsumed is `true` and the first
 * down is consumed in the [PointerEventPass.Main] pass, that gesture is ignored.
 * @param pass The enumeration of passes where [PointerInputChange]
 * traverses up and down the UI tree.
 *
 * PointerInputChanges traverse throw the hierarchy in the following passes:
 *
 * 1. [Initial]: Down the tree from ancestor to descendant.
 * 2. [Main]: Up the tree from descendant to ancestor.
 * 3. [Final]: Down the tree from ancestor to descendant.
 *
 * These passes serve the following purposes:
 *
 * 1. Initial: Allows ancestors to consume aspects of [PointerInputChange] before descendants.
 * This is where, for example, a scroller may block buttons from getting tapped by other fingers
 * once scrolling has started.
 * 2. Main: The primary pass where gesture filters should react to and consume aspects of
 * [PointerInputChange]s. This is the primary path where descendants will interact with
 * [PointerInputChange]s before parents. This allows for buttons to respond to a tap before a
 * container of the bottom to respond to a tap.
 * 3. Final: This pass is where children can learn what aspects of [PointerInputChange]s were
 * consumed by parents during the [Main] pass. For example, this is how a button determines that
 * it should no longer respond to fingers lifting off of it because a parent scroller has
 * consumed movement in a [PointerInputChange].
